# Bitcoin blockchain simulation

This project is a prototype of the Bitcoin blockchain, featuring two main clients: the miner and the wallet. The miner client is responsible for mining blocks and adding them to the blockchain, simulating the proof-of-work process. The wallet client allows users to create new wallets, recover existing ones, and make transfers between accounts.

Together, these components replicate core functionalities of the Bitcoin network, providing a simplified but functional model of decentralized currency management and block verification.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies with npm install.
2. Run the tests with npm test.
3. Run the blockchain server with npm run blockchain.
4. Run the blockchain miner with npm run miner.
5. Run the blockchain wallet with npm run wallet.
